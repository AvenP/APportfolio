# APportfolio
I have made a lot of changes have been made to my portfolio. I am going to write out my readme by section by section. Goggle and W3shools helped me through the process. 

Nav 
Change the background to orange 
Added links to nav words 
Used W3 school to add the hover and text-shadow
Added target blank to resume. To make my resume pop up in a new window.

Picture Section 
Used https://www.magicpattern.design/tools/css-backgrounds to make Rhombus background
Added my picture and gave it a border
I had to play around with the margins to get “welcome text” to settled in the bottom right of the section.

Sidebar
Added flex to the side bar
Gave padding values to create the space between About Me, Work, and Contact me
Made the font size XL to create more movement on the page, when cicking on the links on the nav bar.

About Me
Added flex to the <p> column and wrap
Made the font size large and added 1% padding to fill out the space in the section.

Work
This section took me the longest to figure the boxes out.
After a lot of trial and error I came up with making 4 boxes.
I could not make full the background picture a link. The purple boxes are the link in the pictures.
The 3 boxes are a outer box, top box, bottom box and a small box.
The outer box is flex to stretch out the space.
Top box is the main larger box the stays large as the page shrinks.
Bottom box is the container for the 4 small boxes. Both are flex they are wrapped and space-evenly

Contact Me
Added flex to the section, space-evenly and align items:center
5% padding to space out the section
Added mailto to email me and added target blank to GitHub and LinkedIn
Made link, hover, and visited color changes to Email Me, GitHub, and Linkedin
